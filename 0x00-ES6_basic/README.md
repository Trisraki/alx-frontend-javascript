# 0x00. ES6 Basics

This project covers the fundamentals of ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) in JavaScript. It includes tasks aimed at understanding new features introduced in ES6, such as const and let declarations, arrow functions, default parameters, rest parameters, spread syntax, template literals, object property value shorthand, method properties, and for...of loops.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will be able to:

- Explain what ES6 is and its new features
- Understand the difference between constants and variables
- Utilize block-scoped variables
- Implement arrow functions and default parameters
- Use rest and spread function parameters
- Apply string templating in ES6
- Create objects and properties using ES6 syntax
- Understand iterators and for...of loops

## Requirements

- All files are executed on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using NodeJS 12.11.x
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs, Visual Studio Code
- All files should end with a new line
- Use the `.js` extension for JavaScript files
- Testing is done using the Jest Testing Framework
- Code analysis is performed using ESLint with specific rules provided
- All functions must be exported

## Setup

1. Install NodeJS 12.11.x:

```bash
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x -o nodesource_setup.sh
sudo bash nodesource_setup.sh
